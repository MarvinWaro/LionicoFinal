          <h2>Fade Haircut</h2>
          <p>If we had to name the most popular types of cuts for men, a fade haircut would definitely be on top of the list. Its versatility allows you to match the type of fade to your preferences, hair type and, importantly, face shape. High or low, bald or tapered, the variety of options is endless.</p>

          <h2>Taper Haircut</h2>
          <p>A taper haircut works well with the majority of mens hair cut styles. It keeps the hair on the sides neatly trimmed while drawing attention to the top. So, you are free to choose any style, be it a simple Ivy League or a more elaborate pompadour. The type of taper can vary too, depending on your preferences and style.</p>

          <h2>Buzz Cut</h2>
          <p>A buzz cut is an extremely short man hair cut that can be achieved by simply buzzing all of your hair off with the help of a hair clipper, hence the name. Because it is so easy to get, you do not have to pay a visit to the hair salon but can cut your own hair instead.</p>

          <h2>Crew Cut</h2>
          <p>Men who cannot be bothered with the exhausting styling of their hair, go for a crew cut. This bold and daring haircut allows you to show off your chiseled facial features like no other. Besides, it is one of those guys cuts that require low to zero maintenance, as you can simply hop out of the shower, rub the hair with a towel and you are good to go.</p>

          <h2>Long Top Short Sides Haircut</h2>
          <p>A long top short sides is one of those types of hairstyles for men that will never go out of fashion. This is a timeless classic that looks appropriate in absolutely any ambiance. Besides, it can be pulled off on any hair type and looks flattering on all face shapes.</p>

          <h2>French Crop</h2>
          <p>A French crop is a men hair cut that you would hardly confuse with anything else. It features a long textured fringe while the hair on top is cut so that it is of the same length across the head as the fringe. The sides are usually trimmed short to keep the focus on the top of your head.</p>

          <h2>Undercut</h2>
          <p>Similar to a fade, an undercut is one of the most popular types of haircut for men. It also involves trimming the hair on the sides and back. Yet, unlike a fade, it does not blend seamlessly into the top but creates quite a stiff transition instead. Thanks to this, your hairstyle looks high contrast and sharp.</p>

          <h2>Flow Haircut</h2>
          <p>A flow is all about volume and movement. It adds an effortless and relaxed feel to your look. To get it, your locks should be layered cut so that they remain airy and structured. In case your hair naturally does not have enough volume, you may want to employ a hair dryer after the shower.</p>
